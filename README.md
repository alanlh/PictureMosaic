**Instructions**
1. Make sure you have java installed.
2. Download the code.
3. Create an empty directory with three folders named source, target, and output.
4. Put the images you want the mosaic to be built from in the source directory.
5. Create the target images you want to create in the target directory. A mosaic will be created for each target image using the source images.
6. Open a terminal to where code was downloaded. (Note: Not in the src directory.)
7. If it's your first time, call ./build.sh to build the program. (If you're on Windows, you will need Bash installed.)
8. To run the program, call ./run.sh and follow the instructions there.
9. If there are no errors, the mosaics should be located in the output folder.
